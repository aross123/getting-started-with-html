<h2> How the internet works</h2>
<p>The  WWW (world wide web) is held together entirely by hyperlinks. Hyperlinks are what quite literally make the internet <em>a web</em>, linking one website to another.
</p>
<p>Computers use <b><em>HTTP</em></b> to communicate with browsers, that then send the requests over the internet to servers.These servers then send the requested documents back to our computers</p>
<p><b> HTTP:</b> Hypertext transfer protocol. How data <em>communicates</em> through The Web.</p>

<p><b>HTML:</b> HyperText Markup Language. Language used to <em>build websites</em>.</p>

<p>Computers are <em>not</em> stupid.</br>
They just take things a little too literally sometimes.</p>

<h3>How to create browsers</h3>
<p> HTML is the basis for everything. There are three essential parts of HTML.</p>
<p><b> Text content:</b> What the page is actually going to end up looking like.</p>
<p><b>Markup: </b> Tags, or what you use to to make the content presentable.</br>
Example: b=bold, em=italicized, a=anchor, br=break, p=paragraph.</p>
<p><b>Refrences to other documents:</b> Attributes are what allow you to make links.</br> [Tag ATTR=“value”> contents [/tag></p>

If you ever forget, everything is just a google search away.
